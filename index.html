                    <q>Why be afraid of infinity of truth? Joy resides in every step of growth. </q>
                    <p> My interests in<span> Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</span> and <span>Machine Learning</span>
                        derived from a very young
                        age, when I was often wondered if a series of seeming chaos could ultimately converge to one
                        line
                        of concise description or rule. Or, we could use a rule as a "skeleton" to restore the original
                        development trend of events.</p>
                    <p>For this reason, I chose science and engineering as my subject group in high school. Meanwhile,
                        I
                        read many books
                        about ancient Chinese philosophers and their ideas. They firmly believed that everything can be
                        mathematical abstraction and human are able to master the nature of development of things,
                        where the essence is the combination of factors with their weights continually varying. Their
                        beliefs deeply influenced my outlook on the world and values, and I made up my mind to find
                        the answer for it.
                    </p>
                    <p> I realized that my question can be studied in a link between human and
                        computer. By extracting the high-level pattern of human behaviors or thoughts into
                        programmable and mathematical concepts, computer can proactively speculate customizable
                        operations based on preferences of individuals. This aspect shows the convergence of chaos. 3-D
                        reconstruction also fascinates me, for it demonstrates the reverse process from the "skeleton",
                        the
                        original object.
