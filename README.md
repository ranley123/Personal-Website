# Personal-Website
In order to acquire basic knowledge of networking architecture and  front-end web design, I created a personal (resume) website to push myself to self-learn it. This includes HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery.
The index.html is the main page of the whole website, and ch.html is the Chinese version of my website.
From my website, users are able to know more about me, my personalities, as well as my experience. They can look through my resume page and download it.
This project has not been finished yet. If anyone happens to see this and is interested in helping me, please be free to give your suggestions and I will really appreciate it.
